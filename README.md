# Data Analytics Project
Project part of the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp. Goal was developing a product that helps older folks to buy groceries. It was done throw data gathering, data cleaning and modeling, statistical probablistic analysis and data visualization.

## Overview

The project can be divided in this logic:

1. Problem Setting
2. Data Collection
3. EDA & Deep Dive
4. Statistical Analysis
5. Conclusion and reccomendations


## Problem Setting

2 in 10 persons in Portugal are elderly*

Elders are the fastest growing age group: According to INE, in the next 50 years, the number of elders is going to grow from 2.2 to 3.0 million.

As you grow old, daily tasks become harder: We don't have the same energy, our bones are more fragile and simply going up a staircase can be like climbing Mt. Everest.

Elderly: Person with age 65+. According to PORDATA - Base de Dados de Portugal Contemporâneo

2 in 10 young-adults* in Portugal are unemployed

Finding a job today its harder than it looks: We've all ben there, and most of us here on Ironhack are going throught this again.

Informal jobs are growing at a fast rate: Uber, Bolt and others are an example of the need for people to work.

Young-adults: Person between ages 18-25. According to PORDATA - Base de Dados de Portugal Contemporâneo

The last census, by GNR, accounted for 45,000 elders living alone and 40% of all elderly population spends more than 8 hours a day alone.

Being able to shop for food is an important part of staying well and independent as we age.

One in five (19%) of people aged 80-84 say they have difficulty shopping for groceries. This rises to 60% for those aged over 90.

## Data Collection

The data was collected presentially by observation in SuperCor Restelo (Portuguese Supermarket)

The timeframe is:

10:50 - 11:30
14:10 - 14:40
19:00 - 19:30

Is important to note that it contains heavy bias, because the SuperCor Restelo is a expensive supermarket.

## Statistical Analysis

The probability of an elder going to this supermarket in the next 10 minutes is 92%

The probability of a young person going to this supermarket in the next 10 minutes is 51%

The probability of the person being young given that it carries a small bag is: 32%

The probability of the person being old given that it carries a very large bag is: 17%

The probability of the person carry a small bag given that it is morning: 38%

The probability of the person carry a small bag given that is night: 25%

## Conclusions

Elder people are more active in the morning, younger in the night

No clear relation between age and the amount of groceries that people carry

Younger people are not able to attend the demand of elders

## Reccomendations

Analyse other means to attend this problem

Survey people at the supermarket to analyse more precisely

Ask elders at your building if they need help shopping!
